In this project you are going to evaluate the admissions data of over 1,000 colleges provided to you in "colleges.json". The file "output.txt" is a sample output that I produced to show you what I expect your program's output to look like.

Clarifications on the definitions at play here:

- Applications refer to the number of students that submitted an application to the college.
- Admissions refer to the number of applications that the college accepted to be students.
- Enrollments refer to the number of students that enrolled to attend the college.
